This Verilog was used with a Lattice MachXO3 and 16 segment displays

It's easier to create this repo and strip out all the Diamond atrifacts. <strike>Eventually I will port this to the IceStorm or Synopsys logic-synthesis tool.</strike> I figured out how to get diamond to your Synplify! For now Diamond is required for the LCMXO3LF-6900C-S-EVN dev board I am using because I havent bothered to really understand the ofuscated build system yet.
